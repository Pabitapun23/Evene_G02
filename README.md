The Explore City iOS mobile application provides users with a list of activities they can search, filter, and view details about. Users can purchase tickets, share activities with friends, call the activity's contact number, and add or remove activities from their favorites list. The app also has a page to view the user's purchased ticket history and details. Additionally, the app includes a user profile screen where users can log out of their account.
